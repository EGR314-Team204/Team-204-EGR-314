<td><p>“Perfect. Bought this for our rain barrel to irrigate 12 plants in our raised bed. Setup was fairly easy. I had to use the syringe to prime it initially as described in the manual for first start troubleshooting. It is great that it comes as a kit with all necessary pieces. It has worked flawlessly for a few days since. Will update if I have issues. Honestly I bought a refurbished model here because I wasn't so sure it would work based on some bad reviews online.</p>
<p>Looking back through them I'm pretty sure a lot of people are buying them expecting something much different and bigger. If you have something like a rain barrel and a small vegetable garden this is awesome. Look at the recommended number of spouts and distance, I'm pretty sure if you exceed it this won't work well.

<td>Literally, for the plants. I ran this from our rain barrel to our hanging baskets. We travel quite a bit, so keeping hanging baskets watered and alive is a challenge every year. This thing solves that problem in spades. Honestly, my biggest complaint is that it works TOO well - the watering frequency is determined by how much sun it gets, and in July/August, this gets so much sun that it could probably run half as often without any trouble. So, my advice is, unless you live in the true desert, place this somewhere that only gets half a day of direct sunlight.The only other thing to be aware of is that the pump isn't quiet. It's not terrible, but you can definitely hear it from 10-20 yards away, including inside the house if it's attached to an exterior wall (maybe this would be better if the wall was wood-frame, rather than brick/masonry).</td>

| very impressed. The only drawback to this kit is the lack of drippers. I wish they would have given more. They are proprietary to this kit. I had to add extra drippers via Rain Bird. The Rain Bird is set to use 1/4 tubing. This kit comes with slightly small tubing. 5 or 6mm is my guess. so I had to stretch the tubing some to get it to fit RainBird drippers. (I used a small bolt and nut. -- contact me if you need help with this) over all I have about 20 drippers, and it's supplying enough drip on level "5" to keep my planting bed of soil moist at all times. |     |

<th><p>“Terrible. Do not waste $100 on this piece of junk. Did not work. The only thing it did do was to charge the battery. The pump would never activate. Left it on a table outside in the sun for 3 days. It would not even transfer a single drop of water from the rain barrel to a bowl on top of it. There is no way to turn it on manually which is a bad feature. Needed to wait days just to watch it do nothing. The light indicates the battery is fully charged. Thats all it does.</p>

<th>oriented to the South but the unit does not rotate, per se. The short mast is a proprietary design; round with two flat sides. While this is sturdy it does not rotate. Demos online always show the base just being screwed onto a wooden fence so it can be easily, properly oriented but I needed to mount onto a steel rail. Software setup is a little tedious but it works OK when completed. The firmware update feature did not work. Overall it's a nice unit and I have recommended it to others.”</th>

<td>“This was a birthday gift to my husband. He loved it. The set up was easy and the read out display was large enough to easily see without having to walk closer to it or wear glasses. Everything was great until the temp gauge stopped working. just the outside temperature. Now we had a hot summer for sure, but the unit was only 5 months old at the time. The manufacturer was contacted and without any hassle a new unit was sent and hubby is back to loving his birthday gift again. So great customer support if you ever need it. I would recommend the product.”</td>

<td>“ This is an awesome and very easy to use wifi weather station. The 5-in-1 outdoor sensor includes rain funnel, solar panel and transmission module, wind vane and high-speed anemometer, and transmits current information about temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed and wind direction, as well as the amount of precipitation and UV radiation and so much more. It is very easy to setup and install. I love the easy to read LCD display which shows you all the information needed. The app also gives much of the same features. It has a wide range of use of to 300 feet. It is very durable and sturdy. Very pleased at the overall price and value. Definitely recommend this weather station.”</td>

## Product Requirements

> **Introduction**
>
> Weather is an aspect of the world that remains uncontrolled which oftentimes may impede on everyday activities or special events. This problem leaves room for technological solutions to accommodate unexpected weather patterns in varying situations. That being said, there is a large market for products that have weather sensing capabilities which can in turn help users utilize these devices to adapt their systems to different weather conditions, whatever the case may be. However, not all solutions have been explored leaving room for a new solution to be developed, employing serial sensors, actuation functionality, remote control via internet or app and a Microchip microcontroller.

## Objectives

> Our main objectives are to design and develop a mobile weather station that can respond to the environment using serial sensing and actuation to sense at least two of the following environmental conditions: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed. Also to include at least one motor controlled by a motor controller that communicates over the I2C or SPI-based protocol and data will be broadcasted to the internet over WiFi using the MQTT protocol for real-time monitoring and analysis. All while the design and functionality satisfies the user and stakeholder needs gathered in earlier research.

## Stakeholders

> **Target Group:** Any person looking to use our device to fit their needs when it comes to weather detection and interaction.
>
> **Target Purchaser**: Any person or group who aims to get base measurements of weather, and record noticeable changes.
>
> **Customer Service:** Contact production company
>
> **Retailers**: Online and in store retailers( Amazon, Walmart, adafruit)

## Use Cases

> **User Story \#1:** Jack and Jill want to find and document the weather for a full year to find out the optimal time for their vegetables to grow. They decide to invest in an
>
> at-home weather station to track the temperature and humidity in their immediate location as accurately as possible. With the use of their newfound data, they can plant their produce at the perfect time for a healthy and plentiful season.
>
> **User Story \#2:** Jill wants to keep track of how healthy her plants are and decides to add a solar powered automatic watering device to her planter. This device will detect if her plants have too much or too little water and will add the correct amount accordingly. All of the data can be tracked on her phone so that she knows her plants are getting the correct care.
