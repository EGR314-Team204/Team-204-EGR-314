**Team Organization for Team 204**

**Team Charter:**

As a team we recognize that this class is an opportunity to gain valuable experience in product design and development. Our goals for this class include developing a product that meets the needs of our target market, gaining hands-on experience in the product design process, leveraging our skills and knowledge in embedded systems to design and develop a cutting-edge product, developing a product that can be scaled and sold to multiple industries and learning how to work effectively as a team and how to communicate effectively with team members and stakeholders.We also recognize that success in this project and product design process can take many forms including, eventually selling units of a product, being able to better demonstrate our knowledge to others, developing a new, mind-blowing addition to our portfolio of engineering expertise, furthering a passion of ours, and making new professional connections. Our goal is to use this product design experience to gain valuable skills and knowledge that we can apply to our future careers.

**Our Mission Statement:**

The mission of our team is to successfully brainstorm and develop a product that can measure an aspect of the environment around us and communicate the data received through the internet to the end user.

**Communication Channels and Procedure:**

We will use a combination of Discord, Email and Texts to communicate while outside of class. We plan on meeting up outside of class at certain intervals, which will be detailed below. Answers must be timely and all members must communicate what progress they have done to the other members. This way we stay on track and focused.

**Team Coordination:**

First we will establish clear deadlines for each task and assign specific team members as responsible for submitting the completed work. You can also implement a system of review and approval, where team members review and sign off on each other's work before it is considered final. To ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required for each assignment we will make sure we are all caught up with current topics being covered in class and assist each other in areas where necessary. Additionally we can assign tasks based on each team member's strengths and areas of expertise. Lastly we will establish a clear process for collecting and distributing feedback. This could include a designated team member responsible for compiling feedback and distributing it to the team, or regular team meetings where feedback is discussed and action items are assigned.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

As a smaller team, it is easier for us to communicate with each other. That being said, as a team we must have dedicated roles to keep each member on track for success. For this, we would need a Leader, someone who gives direction and keeps people on track. A Manager would also be advised, as someone who checks progress often and marks down what needs progress by when. FInally, a Compiler would be necessary, as they would be in charge of finalizing each assignment. After consideration, each member of our team has chosen a role for themselves based on where they believe their strength lies.

Nicholas Dunn - Leader

Eduardo Lopez - Manager

Richie Green - Compiler

**Conflict Resolution:**

When conflict arises in the team, it would be best to immediately diffuse the situation by separating the people. Once tempers have calmed, it would be best to attempt to resolve the prior conflict with the help of a third party (other member, professor, someone else, etc.). Should conflict arise and not dissipate, then the people involved must sort it out by themselves. If the conduct becomes detrimental to the group, we will come together and decide if further action is required, ie; removal from the team.
