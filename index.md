## Team Organization
 Need to add:  
 Don't simply copy and paste the content from your original assignment; you need to claim ownership of your material by adding context. Convert this assignment into a report format by adding "connective tissue", that explains how you agreed on a project charter and mission statement rather than just pasting them in.  
Add the remaining sections from your assignment to a new appendix page in the back, titled "Appendix A: Team Organization".  
The Team Organization Page and associated appendix should each be separate subpages linked from the top-level page on your site.

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements
Need to add:  
For example, how did your team organize, combine, and split needs into the list you arrived at? Justify the process by which your team assigned weights for importance, using both interview notes and internal team discussions.  
Discuss the process by which your team converted user needs into specifications.  
Discuss, with detail, how your design will be assessed according to the "aspects", to ensure your product meets your requirements.

## Design Ideation
Need to add:
What role each team member played in generating ideas.  
What types of brainstorming worked? What didn't?  
What was your process for organizing and ranking ideas? Who created or sketched each concept?
