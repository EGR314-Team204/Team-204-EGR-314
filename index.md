## Introduction: Team 204 Semester Project
Add an introduction
Consider moving and updating the introduction from your product requirements document to the front of the report

## Team Organization
 Need to add:  
 Don't simply copy and paste the content from your original assignment; you need to claim ownership of your material by adding context. Convert this assignment into a report format by adding "connective tissue", that explains how you agreed on a project charter and mission statement rather than just pasting them in.  
Add the remaining sections from your assignment to a new appendix page in the back, titled "Appendix A: Team Organization".  
The Team Organization Page and associated appendix should each be separate subpages linked from the top-level page on your site.  
* [Link to Team Organization Page](/TeamOrg)

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements
Need to add:  
For example, how did your team organize, combine, and split needs into the list you arrived at? Justify the process by which your team assigned weights for importance, using both interview notes and internal team discussions.  
Discuss the process by which your team converted user needs into specifications.  
Discuss, with detail, how your design will be assessed according to the "aspects", to ensure your product meets your requirements. 
* [Link to User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements Page](/UserNeed)

## Design Ideation
Need to add:
What role each team member played in generating ideas.  
What types of brainstorming worked? What didn't?  
What was your process for organizing and ranking ideas? Who created or sketched each concept?

## Presentation
 Embed your team's presentation video into a separate page of your site, accessible from the top-level page, using the "embed" function within YouTube.

# Our Design

## Selecting Our Design
Provide a figure/rendering of your product in its current form. Highlight features that satisfy user needs, with labels and arrows. You may update or re-work one of the images from design ideation, or start from scratch if you prefer.

## Block Diagram
Provide an up-to-date, high quality rendering of your team's block diagram  
Discuss each teammate's subsystem and how they together achieve project requirements.

## Component and Microcontroller Selection
Include your component selection section / page.  
Highlight (and only discuss) the selected components, not the unselected alternatives.  
Be prepared to discuss your power budget  
* [Link to Component Selection](/ComponentSelect)

Include your microcontroller selection assignment.  
Be prepared to discuss your selected microcontroller, and the rationale for selecting it over the alternatives, based on your design requirements.  

* [Link to Microcontroller Selection](/MicroSelect)

## Hardware and Software Proposal
Update your project report on your team website to include a high-quality, crisp (not blurry) rendering of your full project schematic(s). Do not use a screenshot.  
Be prepared to discuss your schematic and Bill of Materials  
* Link to Hardware Proposal

Include your software proposal section / page, including a high-quality, crisp (not blurry) copy of your activity diagram(s) or state diagram(s), MCC configuration, and function declarations.  
Be prepared to discuss your UML Diagram 1.
